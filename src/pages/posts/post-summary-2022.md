## Introduction
2022 was another strange year for obvious reasons. I am interested in geopolitics and foreign affairs for quite some time, but this year it was my number one subject as an after work activity. I am not complaining, after all I'm very lucky - it's not me who suffers most due to the war. Anyway, after some time I was able to resume my 'normal' activities, and this post is partly about that. 

I'm going to describe here what I've learned in 2022 (at work and after hours), and what is my plan for 2023, hopefully. 

## At work
### java
It was the another year of reactive spring (_webflux_) for me. I've faced some issues, that made me more humble about this topic. This is mainly due problems related with concurrency and mixing reactive code with blocking code. I used to think, that the main 'cost' of functional reactive code is accidental complexity - business logic full of monadic bloat. But sadly there's much more, if the use case doesn't fit this tool. My current recommendation is to use reactive stack only for (IO) performance intensive services, like proxies and other capabilities. On the other hand I strongly dissuade it in applications with business logic (other than plain transformation/processing), especially if one needs transactions support and/or fancy ORM's mappings.

Like I mentioned above, I spent quite some time on concurrency problems, and due to that I've run test suites many, many times. I spent **hours** on that, and this is because the default approach for spring web apps is layered architecture, so testing business logic (service layer) requires loading spring context and in-memory DB. In such situation one can either go with stable but sloooow solution like test containers that behave exactly like the real DB, or go with alternative repository implementation that uses some in memory DB (like h2 or even just plain Map). The latter is faster, but one can't test easily some DB behaviors like transaction rollbacks, DB triggers etc. I think that the real problem is the design itself, so for apps with non trivial business logic IMO one should consider something like hexagonal (aka onion, ports and adapters) architecture. I've applied such approach in one of the new services and it helped me a lot with testing the logic, and as a side effect it made it easier to split the work because of the loose coupling.

### deno
One of my first task in 2022 was to create a POC for new service. I picked deno and I must say I was satisfied with overall developer experience. It was at the beginning of the year, so [before node packages support announcement](https://deno.land/manual@v1.17.0/npm_nodejs/compatibility_mode), though I didn't miss anything - it was more than enough to create a web server with decent SQLite DB support.

### react
In terms of frontend work I had some minor opportunities to stay in touch with react, but no growth and nothing worth to be mentioned.

### Python
I have also took an opportunity to use some python, finally. It was a lambda for some batch data operations, nothing fancy. My overall experience was ok, but when I was about to do some scripting later, I was (still) picking bash or typescript+deno depending on a use case.


## After hours
### elixir
The goal for the first part of the year was to learn elixir. There were several reasons for that. The most important one was actor model of course. Moreover, I was very curious about BEAM's features, like
- the idea of one, consistent toolbox capable of handling all sorts of needs - the inspiration came from [this table presented by Sasa Juric](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvBT4XBdoUE&t=2266s), and
- hot deployment

I've built [a simple web application for collecting metadata about new podcast episodes available on spotify](https://github.com/frankiewiczkamil/fomos), and I used [built-in DB](https://www.erlang.org/doc/man/dets.html) there. It was cool, though I think that the main elixir use case nowadays is performant web servers with pre-configured stuff. In other words: performant rails.

It was very interesting experience and I **really** enjoyed the language. It felt very natural to me. I keep my fingers cross for [the ongoing work around the set-theoretic types](https://twitter.com/josevalim/status/1577680998124470273), because I guess _some_ type guarantees is a must for a modern, mature language and current types support in elixir is not enough.

### frontend/javascript
As we know, this year was full of new ideas, projects and events in js world. I've discovered, that beside reading some weekly summaries, another **great** source of knowledge is Ryan Carniato with his [weekly live sessions on yt](https://www.youtube.com/@ryansolid/playlists) and his [twitter profile](https://twitter.com/RyanCarniato). You might know him as a solid.js creator, but he does more than that. I enjoyed his detailed and impartial analysis that helped me understand what are the challenges of modern the web development and what are the use cases for react+next/remix, solid.js and for qwik. In fact I have read and watched his older materials and I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to understand better how frontend libraries are different and what are the tradeoffs. 

### other
Similarly to the previous years I've been following big conferences, like GOTO, Devoxx etc, though I think the most influential videos for me were some 'old' recordings of Rick Hickey recommended by [Jakub Neander (aka Zaiste)](https://twitter.com/zaiste) in his series done together with [Micha≈Ç Miszczyszyn (Type of Web)](https://typeofweb.com/) in [Programistyczny Rozhowor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kPpfqJqgNg)  (I highly recommend this series for polish speakers, BTW).

Another interesting perspective for me, was Brian Goetz explaining the direction of Java development. We all know that it's slow, but I've started to appreciate more the pragmatic and stable approach that Java creators present. I'm really excited about the future of the loom project and adapting structured programming model into Java, because it became obvious now that we need a good defaults for performant IO heavy apps.


## Plans for 2023
### frontend

I'd like to do more frontend in 2023, though I'm not sure yet which solutions I'll try. Perhaps I'll start with learning about new server side rendering features, like [render as you fetch](https://17.reactjs.org/docs/concurrent-mode-suspense.html#approach-3-render-as-you-fetch-using-suspense). Moreover, I'd like to do something using solid.js, especially because I'm really curious if the performance is that good (I have some experience in react+redux tuning). And of course I'll keep practising astro, because this is what this blog is using now.

### backend 
There is a project loom that I need to try, but beside that I'd like to focus more on some higher level concepts, so most likely I'll read more about DDD. Maybe I'll also try clojure, because I've heard so much good about it and like I mentioned before Rick Hickey - the language creator - made me rethink many things, I'm impressed with his diagnosis and simplicity he suggests, so I'm intrigued to the point I need to try his stuff. 

**Happy New Year!**
