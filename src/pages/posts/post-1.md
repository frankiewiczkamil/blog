The time has come, and I decided to finally expose some of my thoughts to the world. I've been a pure lurker for years and to be honest I'm still not sure if my perspective might be something interesting to anyone. However, one of the goals here is to fight my imposter syndrome and my inner critic, so it seems a good idea to give it a shot.

Moreover, time flies, and I figured that I need a place, a sort of diary or a notebook to gather and summarize what I've already learned. Sometimes it's about a cheatsheet with some tricks, and sometimes about a more sophisticated conclusion that I forged in pain. Anyway, I can't remember how many times I was trying to recall something that I have had already grasped in the past, but without the clue how can I restore this ancient wisdom. I've been using evernote for notes, and, github for storing useful examples. It's better than nothing, but now it's gonna improve, by connecting those two ideas.

Finally, I've noticed that the process of explaining and describing complex problems helps me a lot to wrap up my thoughts. Nothing new, but that also means it makes perfect sense to write it down somewhere, just like we do with our colleagues or a rubber duck when we are in a trouble. So hopefully, I will be able to solve some of my problems and at the same time share to the world (and maybe even get some feedback, we'll see), a win-win.

I'm not sure at this point if it'll be only IT stuff that I'll be writing about, but that's the main subject for sure. Time will tell.

I suspect that the form of the posts will vary depending on the topic and how much is to say. My goal is not limited to publishing only long essays or analyses or HOWTOs, but rather picking the most suitable form, even twitter-like messages for ideas that I'll consider valuable.

See you soon 🖖
